Problem 134 : Gas Station

You are given two integer arrays, gas and cost, each of length n, representing a circular route with n gas stations. At station i, you can fill up gas[i] units of fuel, and it costs cost[i] units of fuel to travel from station i to the next one (i + 1). You start with an empty tank and can begin at any station.

Your task is to determine the starting station’s index from which you can complete a full circuit in the clockwise direction. If it’s impossible to travel around the route once, return -1. It is guaranteed that if a valid starting point exists, it is unique.

Example 1:
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
