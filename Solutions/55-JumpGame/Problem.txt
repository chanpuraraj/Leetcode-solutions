Problem 55 - Jump Game

You are given an integer array nums, where each element represents the maximum number of steps you can jump forward from that position. Starting from the first index, your goal is to determine whether it’s possible to reach the last index of the array. If you can reach the end, return true; otherwise, return false.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump from index 0 → 1 → 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You get stuck at index 3 since it allows no further jumps.
