Problem 238 - Product of Array Except Self
You are given an integer array nums, and your task is to return another array answer, where each element answer[i] equals the product of all numbers in nums except nums[i]. The solution must be computed in O(n) time complexity without using the division operator. It is guaranteed that the product of any prefix or suffix in the array will fit within a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
