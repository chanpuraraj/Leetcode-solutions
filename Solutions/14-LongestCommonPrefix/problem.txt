Problem 14: Longest Common Prefix

Write a function that determines the longest common prefix shared by all strings in a given array. If the strings do not share any starting sequence, return an empty string.

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
Output: "fl"

Example 2:
Input: strs = ["dog", "racecar", "car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: These strings have no common starting prefix.
