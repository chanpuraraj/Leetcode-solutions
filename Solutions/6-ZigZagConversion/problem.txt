Problem 6: ZigZag Conversion

Given a string s, write it in a zigzag pattern across a specified number of rows. Characters are placed diagonally and vertically in a repeating pattern, like this (shown in fixed-width style):

For example, with 3 rows, the string "PAYPALISHIRING" becomes :PAHNAPLSIIGYIR

Example 1:
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Example 2:
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
