Problem 122 - Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

You are given an integer array prices, where each element represents the stock price on a specific day. You can perform multiple buy and sell transactions to maximize profit, but you can only hold one share at a time. You may sell and buy again on the same day as long as you donâ€™t hold more than one stock simultaneously. The goal is to calculate the maximum total profit possible.

Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy at 1, sell at 5 (profit 4); buy at 3, sell at 6 (profit 3); total = 7.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
