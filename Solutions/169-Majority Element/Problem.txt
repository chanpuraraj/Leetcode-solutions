Problem 169: Majority Element

The task is to find the majority element in a given integer array nums of size n.
A majority element is defined as the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times in the array.
It is guaranteed that such an element always exists.
The goal is to identify and return this majority element based on the given input array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3, 2, 3]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Output: 2
