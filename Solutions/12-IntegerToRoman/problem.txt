Problem 12: Integer to Roman

Roman numerals are represented using seven symbols, each with a specific value:
I = 1, V = 5, X = 10, L = 50, C = 100, D = 500, and M = 1000.
Numbers are written by combining these symbols from highest to lowest value. However, when a number begins with 4 or 9, a subtractive form is used — a smaller numeral is placed before a larger one (e.g., IV = 4, IX = 9). Valid subtractive combinations are IV, IX, XL, XC, CD, and CM. Symbols representing powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can appear up to three times consecutively, while V, L, D cannot repeat.

Given an integer, convert it to its Roman numeral representation.

Example 1:
Input: num = 3749 → Output: "MMMDCCXLIX"

Example 2:
Input: num = 58 → Output: "LVIII"

Example 3:
Input: num = 1994 → Output: "MCMXCIV"
